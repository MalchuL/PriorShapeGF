    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input pointcloud
            (default: 3, for X, Y, Z coordinates respectively).
        feat_size (int): Size of the global feature vector
            (default: 1024)
        layer_dims (Iterable[int]): Sizes of fully connected layers
            to be used in the feature extractor (excluding the input and
            the output layer sizes). Note: the number of
            layers in the feature extractor is implicitly parsed from
            this variable.
        global_feat (bool): Extract global features (i.e., one feature
            for the entire pointcloud) if set to True. If set to False,
            extract per-point (local) features (default: True).
        activation (function): Nonlinearity to be used as activation
                    function after each batchnorm (default: F.relu)
        batchnorm (bool): Whether or not to use batchnorm layers
            (default: True)
        transposed_input (bool): Whether the input's second and third dimension
            is already transposed. If so, a transpose operation can be avoided,
            improving performance.
            See documentation for the forward method for more details.
